<p>Trestle Ties' mission is to create a bridge to publication and access to readers for emerging writers. We seek to create a safe and respectful place for emerging voices and to foster new writers. We also want to cultivate diversity, in both voice and form.</p>
<p>We aim to make the process of submission and publication open to allÂ at no cost to the writer. We respect that submitting one's work is an anxious and personal process and do our best to be transparent about our decisions and process.</p>
<p>We chose the name Trestle Ties to represent the role we hope to play in writers' lives and the lives of the community. Trestles are bridges that convey large amounts of people, goods and ideas. Ties help keep the track stable and moving for miles and miles. Building on this metaphor, we hope each writer whose work is showcased will be a tie in our ongoing adventure to keep poetry at the forefront of literary culture.</p>
<p>Literature is not just a tool to depict feelings, but also a way to access history, people and a vehicle to be political. Trestle Ties will help make tracks to  lend strength and stability to the process of producing work. We hope to help create community by showcasing emerging works.</p><br />
<p>Thank you for reading and submitting to Trestle Ties.</p>
