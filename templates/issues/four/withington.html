<h2>Laundry Day Meditation</h2>
<p>This is how I do Shuvah:</p>
<p>Breathe. Sync with Septemberâ€™s slow breeze.<br />
Squeeze laundry before hanging. Water a ring of clover round the line.<br />
Move pegs softly. Break webs when necessary.<br />
Stand still when chipmunks scamper. Let them fetch acorns.<br />
Gather ten witnesses: honeybees, crunchy maple leaves, toadstools.<br />
Apologize to the earth for my car in the driveway, the power line linking homes,<br />
styrofoam cup from the drive-through.</p>
<p>Listen to the mid-afternoon silence. New beginnings<br />
come in the tired buzz of late cicadas, tread of bare feet,<br />
whispered rustle of swaying grass.</p>
<br />
