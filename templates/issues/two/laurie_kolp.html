<h2>Tarred in Sand Cento</h2>
<p>
We are sticky in our old friendship,<br />
wish the minutes new identities&mdash;<br />
<br />
the blood of the lover I wanted to save.<br />
How the light is bent in your voice.<br />
<br />
It articulates sunlight and shadows,<br />
ink from the corners of my mouth.<br />
<br />
The waves encroach like death,<br />
jeopardize the birdsong of our days<br />
<br />
keeping what you left between us<br />
shawled in the salt scrim of a sea breeze.<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
