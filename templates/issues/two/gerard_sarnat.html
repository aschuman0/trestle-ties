<h2>1. Moby’s Perverted Sour Grapes </h2>
<p>
Our bearded baked bear or drunk whale of a <br />
dick mentor harpooned my new festooned work,<br />
Keep dialects/slang to their bare minimum<br />
IF you must use them here. Nada head-hopping <br />
or POV changes. Oughta revert to Ahab being naked,<br />
preferably with Jezebel, the ancient Tyre king’s fat daughter.<br />

<h2>2. While Catching Up On My Medical Reading</h2>
<h3>i. Hemolacria*</h3>
<p>
I cried blood entering Colma,<br />
the confounding company town <br />
which was zoned just for burial biz<br />
which is relevant<br />
since we were going there to witness<br />
our friend being put to rest <br />
underground.<br />
<br />
On the way, back of a black limo <br />
occupied by loved ones, <br />
I wondered out loud <br />
if there may exist similar villages<br />
where all your births take place<br />
and absolutely everyone’s required<br />
to pour forth tears of pure joy.<br />

<h3>ii. Burton Lines*</h3>
<p class="text-center">
A 39-year-old man is brought to my emergency room<br />
from a local international airport.<br />
<br />
He reported feeling very ill after the ingestion<br />
of thirty packs of opium weighing fifty grams each.<br />
<br />
The mule admitted this was his fifteenth trip<br />
for a drug cartel which paid good money post delivery.<br />
<br />
On inspection, this gent had gray gingival abnormalities<br />
-- the classic sign I read about way back in med school of<br />
<br />
chronic poisoning by lead that turned out to contaminate<br />
what was seen on CAT and which eventually passed.<br />

<h3>iii. Geez, GC’s Come A Long Way In Four Decades.</h3>
<p>
In 1975, winging it in Marin County’s Point Reyes National Seashore <br />
with my wife and first baby, I did natural childbirth home deliveries <br />
on the back of pickup trucks up in the Russian River <br />
down to hippy communes in San Francisco’s Tenderloin<br />
where blithered acidheads blithely pushed out LSD-blighted detritus. <br />
<br />
As a sidelight, before the AIDs epidemic or VD resistance, <br />
I gave highly-effective penicillin shots to Jessie Colin Young, <br />
Jefferson Airplane, Grateful Dead men when they went on tour.<br />
<br />
In 2015, the Obama administration deemed on-the-rise gonorrhea<br />
by far the most common as well as one of the two most urgent<br />
infectious public health threats to national security <br />
because of accelerating emergences of antibiotic unresponsiveness <br />
in these organisms which may soon require new experimental drugs<br />
such as Zoliflodacin (ETX0914), maybe extended hospital stays <br />
plus present $erious burdens to international health care systems.*<br />
<br />
Children of our children, take care.<br />
