<h2>9 to 5</h2>
<p>
sometimes a bird clamps on a train track<br />
for its early morning song --<br />
an inverted question mark with a dot<br />
for the world<br />
<br />
the first hint<br />
of a train<br />
tickles the birdâ€™s claw<br />
like a Richter scribble<br />
<br />
long before the train trundles in<br />
before the screech of its wheels<br />
cracks the dawn<br />
and the tracks trivialize the song<br />
</p>
