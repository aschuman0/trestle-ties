<h2>Awakening</h2>
<p>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<i>For Bei Dao</i>
<br /><br />
Today,<br />
even the only answer,<br />
raised like a child’s hand <br />
begins to blink,<br />
<br />
built up like a city<br />
to open ecology’s lid<br />
where the mask tears up<br />
and the letter-shreds <br />
burn toward heaven<br />
with shaking fists.<br />
<br />
A newborn,<br />
screaming like iron ore,<br />
today is a chisel<br />
yearning for badlands,<br />
wedged behind protest<br />
under a blinking hammer.<br />
<br />
Tomorrow still grips <br />
the controls of a sleeping bull,<br />
through the thin double reed<br />
of advertising<br />
</p>

<h2>Thoughts of a Dying Tree</h2>
<p>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<i>For my Father</i><br />
<br />
There are no questions <br />
for there is no speech,<br />
each sphere suggesting trills <br />
in a calm notation.<br />
<br />
Where, up north, an angel <br />
glowers — south, discarded <br />
needles redden, in a passive <br />
axis, celebrating death.<br />
<br />
What happened to the wings <br />
of each star’s direction, <br />
every interaction<br />
camouflaged by unity? <br />
<br />
What mathematic shadow<br />
that surrounds<br />
this earth of fiction<br />
with its mind of chance<br />
<br />
falls free from the bones,<br />
and like description, gathers <br />
around an absent root?<br />
That’s why<br />
<br />
we need a coney fire<br />
and a coffin to choose.<br />
